    <h1><strong>Reflection Questions</strong></h1>
    <P>1. How does using <strong>alt text</strong> improve accessibility?</P>
    <p>If an image is unable to load or there is an issue with the browser it still allows
        the user a way to see a description of the image so they can understand the context
        on the webpage
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Why should you use <strong>multiple &lt;source&gt; elements</strong> for video and audio? </p>
    <p>Like images, if a browser or user is unable to load a specific file type such as .wav then having
        a second or multiple identical files, differing only by file type, then it allows a better chance for the
        user to see the content.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>3. What are the advantages of <strong>embedding a YouTube video instead of hosting it directly?</strong> </p>
    <p>You do not have to host, store, serve, etc the file yourself, rather YouTube does. Additionally, youtube
        has many features built in such as quto quality configuration, cross-platform functionality, and many
        more that you would not have to implement.
