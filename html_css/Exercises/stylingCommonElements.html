    <!-- Task 1: Font Styling -->
    <h1>How to flip a pancake</h1>
    <p>First you have to get your trusty spatula from the drawer. Make sure it is the best because you
        need absolute precision if you want to flip your pancake.
    </p>
    <p class="italic-paragraph">Now that you have your spatula, carefully slide it underneath your pancake.
        Once the pancake is sitting atop your spatula lift it upwards and quickly rotate it so that the
        pancake falls back onto the stovetop.
    </p>

    <!--
    Q: What happens if you use a custom font that is not installed on a userâ€™s device?
    A: If a font cannot be used then the next defined font will takes its place. In this case if the user does not have
        Arial for some reason, then the next font that will be used is Helvetica.
    -->

    <!-- Task 3: Styling Lists -->
    <h2>Ingredients for Pancakes</h2>
    <ul class="custom-bullets">
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Make Pancakes</h2>
    <ol class="roman-list">
        <li>Mix all ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Pour batter onto the pan.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancake when bubbles appear.</li>
    </ol>

    <!--
    Q: What is the difference between list-style-type: none; and list-style-position: inside;?
    A: list-style-type: none; completely removes the bullet points. list-style-position: inside adds the bullet
    point as part of the content box meaning that text would wrap underneath the bullet instead of next to it

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:

1. Why is it important to use fallback fonts in CSS? 
    If a user is unable to load a font, fallback fonts allow a way to still see text on the screen
    without making a blank page

2. How do spacing and alignment impact the readability of text? 
    It can help clarify words and letters by giving them enough space or keeping them tight to allow a block
    of information. It can also help clarify different sections of text based on their styles

3. How can pseudo-classes improve user experience with links? 
    The best way it improves user experience is allowing them to easily understand which links have already
    been visited so they don't accidentally go to the same link multiple times, or conversely, it helps them
    find a link to a website they want to revisit.

4. Why should images be styled carefully to maintain aspect ratio? 
    If images lose their aspect ratio they can become warped and look weird, so maintaining aspect
    ratio is important if we want to maintain professionalism and help create a good user experience.
