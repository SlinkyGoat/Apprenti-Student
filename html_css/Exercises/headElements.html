Reflection Questions:

1. How does a favicon improve the branding and user experience
    It makes the website easier to recognize allowing both a more professional look
    and the ability to quickly find the website again if hidden among tabs or
    a favorites list

2. Why is metadata important for search engines and browsers
    Metadata is important for search engines via SEO because it allows them to quickly and
    easily access your website and create a summary as to what the website does. It is also
    important for the browser so it can handle things such as different sizes for
    different devices via the viewport meta tag

3. How does the viewport meta tag impact how a website appears on mobile screens.
    If the viewport tag does NOT exist then it will shrink the page to fit the screen
    making a very awkward user experience if being viewed on a vertical device such as
    a mobile phone. If the viewport tag exists then the content remains the same size, but
    now it rolls over onto the next line rather than just shrinking.
