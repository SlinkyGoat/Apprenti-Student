            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Once you choose a class you do not have to stick to it. You can mix and match different class
            abilities through <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/947-how-to-multiclass-in-d-d-for-beginners">multi-classing</a>.</p>

            <p>This comprehensive guide explains <strong>the best classes</strong> to play in D&D</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Barbarian</li>
                <li>Wizard</li>

                <li>Druid</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Barbarian</strong> is the simplest of the simple. While in battle, your trusty sword will never let you down and
            any handy-dandy magical teammates can buff you to shwo off your strong muscles.</p>

            <p><strong>Wizard</strong> falls on the opposite side of the spectrum. They use their extensive knowledge to
            win battles with their wits rather than their fists by slinging catastrophic spells all around the battlefield.</p>

            <p><strong>Bard</strong> doesn't care about strength or wits, but rather the musci of their instruments. Perfect
            for the player who loves to talk and explore the city.</p>

            <p><strong>Druid</strong> focuses on the connection with the wild rather than the social life of the city like the bard.
            They specialize in magic and become powerful when in their element.</p>

Reflection Questions

1. How does using inline elements improve the readability and functionality of a web page? 

    It allows items on the page to be structured horizontally (next to each other) which provides much more visually pleasing
layout and easier to read rather than everything being stacked on top of one another.


2. Why is it important to use semantic tags like <strong> and <em> instead of just <b> and <i>? 

    It helps describe to meaning about the content which can be beneficial for things like bots or webscrapers

3. How can you make sure your hyperlinks are accessible and provide a good user experience? 

    You should ensure they are easily visible such as using the <a> tag which already colors and underlines it. Additionally, you
    should use text that makes sense to click rather than having a random box or word in the middle of a paragraph.
