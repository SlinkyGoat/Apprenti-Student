        <p>Dear Anthony, </p>

        <p>I am writing to discuss your opinion on D&D classes. You stated that
            Wizards are the best when clearly Monks are superior. This letter 
            serves as a formal introduction and an opportunity to explore potential 
            collaboration or address the matter at hand. 
        </p>

        <p>In consideration of an unending conflict of times, I would like to propose a duel
            against a Tarrasque. I believe that doing so will prove the superior class. If 
            necessary, I am happy to provide additional information or discuss this further 
            at your earliest convenience. 
        </p>

        <p>Action Items</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A Tarrasque Model</li>
            <li>Character Sheet</li>
            <li>Lots of Dice</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my letter. I appreciate your consideration and 
            look forward to your response. Please feel free to contact me at 414-532-6500
            should you require any further information. I am available at your convenience to 
            discuss this matter further. 
        </p>

            Sincerely,
